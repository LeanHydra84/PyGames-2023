1. To run this program you must first have Python 3 installed
2. To run this program you must also have pygame installed

3. If you're using Visual Studio Code and you're getting yellow squigglies around 'import pygame':
    >Press Control+Shift+P
    >Search for python select interpreter
    >Select "Python: Select Interpreter"
    >Choose the version of python you installed
This will change the interpreter to the python you have installed and not the one packaged with
the VSCode Python package.
